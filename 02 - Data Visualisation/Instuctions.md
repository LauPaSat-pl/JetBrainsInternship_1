# Theory
## Matplotlib
Now you'll probably find the matplotlib documentation more useful, than in the previous task, so here's a link to it: [Matplotlib documentation](https://matplotlib.org/stable/contents.html).

We will create just a basic bar chart in this task, but you can create more complex visualisations using Matplotlib. Feel free to explore the documentation and create more visualisations about the data provided in the task or any other data you find interesting.
## Data Visualisation
Data visualisation is the graphical representation of information and data. By using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualisation tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data. The data is often presented in a visual format to help the audience understand the data and make informed decisions based on the data. If you want to read more theory about data visualisation, you can check the following link: [Data Visualisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_and_information_visualization).

# Instructions
Follow the steps below to complete the task. You should write your code in the `main.py` file and do NOT change the function signature of the functions provided in the `main.py` file as they are required for testing. If you want to test your code, you can check the reference solution in the `solution.py` file.
1. Copy 'load_data' function from the previous task to 'main.py' file. You will need this function to load the data from the 'game_counts.csv' file. You will need to change it a bit to select index and set the correct order of the columns.
2. Create a plot that's similar to the 'final plot_example.png' file. The plot should show the number of games released. The x-axis should represent the platform, and the y-axis should represent the number of games released. The plot should have a title, x-axis label, y-axis label, and a legend. The plot should be saved as 'games_per_year.png' in this folder. 

    For your convenience, we have provided the steps you should add to create correct plot as well as part of the code where you set the constants. If you change those lines, your chart may fail automatic grader.
 

Congratulations! You have successfully completed the course. Good luck with your future data visualisation endeavours!
